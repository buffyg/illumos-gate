.SH NAME
webrev \- Generate HTML codereview materials
.SH SYNOPSIS
webrev <file.list> | [-] | [-w [<wx file>]] | [-l [-f flp]] 

.SH DESCRIPTION
webrev takes a file list and a workspace
and builds a set of HTML files suitable for doing
a code review of source changes via a web page.

Basic usage is:

	$ webrev file.list

where 'file.list' is a file containing the pathnames of all the files
you wish to include in the review.  webrev creates a "webrev" directory
in the workspace directory that contains all the generated HTML files.
It also stashes a copy of the file list in that directory.

1) If you use the -l option, "webrev -l", webrev extracts the file list
from the output of "putback -n" that will include any files updated,
created, or currently checked out.  This is the easiest way to use
webrev.  If you use the "-l" option to generate the file list then skip
to step (4).  Note: if the workspace is large (e.g. all of Solaris
usr/src then this might take a while. You can run "webrev -l -f flp" to
have webrev extract a file list from the output of "putback -n -f
flp".  The file list created by "webrev -l" is stashed in the
webrev directory as "file.list".

If you would like more control over the file list then
create a file containing a list of all the files to
be included in your review with paths relative to your
workspace directory, e.g.

.IP
usr/src/uts/common/fs/nfs/nfs_subr.c
usr/src/uts/common/fs/nfs/nfs_export.c
usr/src/cmd/fs.d/nfs/mountd/mountd.c
.br
:

.PP
Include the paths of any files added, deleted, or modified.
You can keep this list of files in the webrev directory
that webrev creates in your workspace directory
(CODEMGR_WS).

2) webrev needs to be able locate your workspace and
its parent.  If you have already activated your workspace
with the "ws" command then webrev will use the
CODEMGR_WS environment variable.  If you are not working
within a workspace activation, then you need to set
the environment variable within the file list, e.g.

.IP
CODEMGR_WS=/home/brent/myws

usr/src/uts/common/fs/nfs/nfs_subr.c
usr/src/uts/common/fs/nfs/nfs_export.c
usr/src/cmd/fs.d/nfs/mountd/mountd.c
.br
:

.PP
If you would like to compare against some other workspace
that is not the parent, then you can set the CODEMGR_PARENT
environment variable in the file list, e.g.

.IP
CODEMGR_WS=/home/brent/myws
.br
CODEMGR_PARENT=/ws/onnv-gate

usr/src/uts/common/fs/nfs/nfs_subr.c
usr/src/uts/common/fs/nfs/nfs_export.c
usr/src/cmd/fs.d/nfs/mountd/mountd.c
.br
:

.PP
3) Run webrev with the name of the file containing
the file list as an argument, e.g.

.IP
$ webrev file.list

.PP
If you supply "-" as the name of the file, then stdin
will be used.

If you use the "-w" flag, i.e. "webrev  -w  file.list"
then webrev will assume the file list is in the format
expected by the "wx" package: pathname lines alternating
with SCCS comment lines separated by blank lines, e.g.

.IP
usr/src/uts/common/fs/nfs/nfs_subr.c

1206578 Fix spelling error in comment

usr/src/uts/common/fs/nfs/nfs_export.c

4039272 cstyle fixes

usr/src/cmd/fs.d/nfs/mountd/mountd.c

1927634 mountd daemon doesn't handle expletives

.PP
Embedded bug ids and ARC cases will be converted to a URL (see
below).

4) For each file in the list, webrev will compare it
with the version in the parent workspace (CODEMGR_PARENT)
and generate context and side-by-side diffs (sdiffs) as
HTML files as well as HTML renderings of the old and new
files with prepended line numbers for easy cross-checking
with diffs.

The HTML files will have additional formatting to
color code the source lines:

.IP
     unchanged : black
       removed : brown
       changed : blue
           new : bold blue

 
.PP
5) Webrev will create a directory $CODEMGR_WS/webrev
and create the HTML files in a hierarchy beneath
this directory. Links to these HTML files will be
built into an index.html file in the "webrev" directory.
If you would like the "webrev" directory to appear
somewhere other than $CODEMGR_WS, then set the WDIR
environment variable, e.g.

.IP
       WDIR=/tmp webrev -l

.PP
Each file will be listed on a line with a link to its Cdiffs, Udiffs,
Wdiffs, Sdiffs, Frames, Old, and New versions.  A blank line will be
inserted between filenames that do not exist within the same directory
as a grouping aid.  SCCS comments for each delta will be included
automatically. Bug numbers (any sequence of 5 or more digits) and ARC
cases (ARC name followed by year/number, e.g. PSARC/2003/436) in the
comment will become a URL into the associated web interface.

.PP
As a review aid, you can add value to the index
file by including text that explains the changes in front
of the links for each file.  You might also add links
to the one-pager, project plan, or other documents
helpful to the reviewer.

6) View the index.html file with your web browser to 
verify that its what you want your reviewers to see.
The browser must support HTML tables and colored fonts. 
The Frames view requires HTML frames and JavaScript, as does Wdiff
which also requires Dynamic HTML support.

7) Then send an Email invitation to your reviewers including
the URL to the index.html file in your workspace.  If you
use an "http:" URL then you can omit the "index.html"
filename, e.g.

.IP
To: bob, jane, wendy
.br
Subject: Please review fix for bug 1234576

I'd be grateful if you would review my bugfix.
All the relevant information can be obtained
with the following URL:

Thanks

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables allow for easy customization of
webrev.

.IP
CDIFFCMD and UDIFFCMD are used when generating Cdiffs and Udiffs
respectively; their default values are "diff -b -C 5" and "diff -b -U
5".  To generate diffs with more (or less) than 5 lines of context or
with more (or less) strict whitespace handling, set one or both of
these variables in your environment accordingly.

WEBREV_FRAMES allows you to disable the creation of framed webrevs
which are enabled by default.  Framed webrevs provide complete
side-by-side comparisons utilizing HTML frames with JavaScript to aid
in moving through the differences similar to filemerge.  To disable
this feature set WEBREV_FRAMES=no in your environment.

WEBREV_BUGURL may be set to an alternate bug to HTML interface
(providing the BUG number can be appended to the URL).  The default
URL is "http://monaco.sfbay.sun.com/detail.jsp?cr=".

WDIFF specifies the command used to generate Wdiffs. Wdiff generates a
full unified context listing with line numbers where unchanged
sections of code may be expanded and collapsed.  It also provides a
"split" feature that shows the same file in two HTML frames one above the
other.  The default path for this script is
/ws/onnv-gate/public/bin/wdiff but WDIFF may be set to customize this
to use a more convenient location.
