# Special mapfile to establish h_errno as a filter on libnsl.  As a filtered
# symbol, this isn't visible to apptrace, and thus doesn't have to be defined
# from the specfiles.  To ensure the symbol remains in .bss, with the correct
# size, its filtering capabilities are assigned here rather than via a specfile.

		h_errno = FILTER libnsl.so.1;
